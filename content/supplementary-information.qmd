## Situation Analysis {-}

The following situation model was developed by the WCRP planning team to “map” the project context and brainstorm potential actions for implementation. Green text is used to identify actions that were selected for implementation (see Strategies & Actions), and red text is used to identify actions that the project team has decided to exclude from the current iteration of the plan, given that they were either outside of the project scope or were deemed to be ineffective by the planning team.

## Strategies & Actions {-}

In 2021, the Lower Nicola River watershed and many other parts of BC experienced devastating forest fires and floods. Prior to this, CWF worked with the Scw’exmx Tribal Council to assess priority barriers for rehabilitation that were identified through longitudinal models and undertake preliminary assessments of local priorities for potential lateral connectivity remediation. Recognizing that there may be other urgent restoration priorities in the watershed, the Planning Team decided that the current areas of focus will be on reviewing LiDAR, aerial imagery, and field assessments to determine immediate lateral connectivity needs (see Action 1.5 below), responding to new barriers that may have developed in the watershed, and addressing other emerging needs in the watershed. The Planning Team will focus on the remaining strategies and actions in the table below in future years.

Effectiveness evaluation of identified conservation strategies and associated actions to improve connectivity for focal species in the Lower Nicola River watershed. The planning team identified five broad strategies to implement through this WCRP, (1) lateral barrier rehabilitation (priority on reconnecting thermal refugia), (2) stream crossing remediation, (3) dam remediation, (4) barrier prevention, and (5) progress tracking plan. Individual actions were qualitatively evaluated based on the anticipated effect each action will have on realizing on-the-ground gains in connectivity. Effectiveness ratings are based on a combination of "Feasibility" and "Impact". Feasibility is defined as the degree to which the project team can implement the action within realistic constraints (financial, time, ethical, etc.) and Impact is the degree to which the action is likely to contribute to achieving one or more of the goals established in this plan.

## Theories of Change & Objectives {-}

Theories of Change explicitly state assumptions around how the identified actions will achieve gains in connectivity and contribute to achieving the goals of the plan. To develop theories of change, the planning team developed explicit assumptions for each strategy which helped to clarify the rationale used for undertaking actions and provided an opportunity for feedback on invalid assumptions or missing opportunities. The theories of change are results oriented and clearly define the expected outcome. The following theory of change models were developed by the WCRP planning team to “map” the causal (“if-then”) progression of assumptions of how the actions within a strategy work together to achieve project goals.
