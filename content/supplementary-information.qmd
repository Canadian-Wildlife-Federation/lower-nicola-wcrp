## Situation Analysis {-}

The following situation model was developed by the WCRP planning team to “map” the project context and brainstorm potential actions for implementation. Green text is used to identify actions that were selected for implementation (see Strategies & Actions), and red text is used to identify actions that the project team has decided to exclude from the current iteration of the plan, given that they were either outside of the project scope or were deemed to be ineffective by the planning team.

## Strategies & Actions {-}

In 2021, the Lower Nicola River watershed and many other parts of BC experienced devastating forest fires and floods. Prior to this, CWF worked with the Scw’exmx Tribal Council to assess high-ranking structures and undertake preliminary assessments of potential lateral barriers identified by local experts and knowledge holders. Recognizing that there may be other urgent restoration priorities in the watershed, the Planning Team decided that the areas of focus over the short term would be on reviewing LiDAR (light detection and ranging), aerial imagery, and field assessments to determine immediate lateral connectivity needs (see Action 1.5 below), responding to new barriers that may have developed in the watershed following the atmospheric river event, and addressing other emerging needs in the watershed. The Planning Team began focusing on the remaining strategies and actions in the table below @tbl-S1 in 2023. 

The planning team identified five broad strategies to implement through this WCRP: (1) lateral barrier rehabilitation (priority on reconnecting thermal refugia), (2) stream crossing rehabilitation, (3) dam rehabilitation, (4) barrier prevention, and (5) partner development. Individual actions were qualitatively evaluated based on the anticipated effect each action will have on realizing on-the-ground gains in connectivity. Effectiveness ratings are based on a combination of "Feasibility" and "Impact." Feasibility is defined as the degree to which the project team can implement the action within realistic constraints (financial, time, ethical, etc.), and Impact is the degree to which the action is likely to contribute to achieving one or more of the goals established in this plan.

## Theories of Change & Objectives {-}

Theories of Change explicitly state assumptions about how the identified actions will achieve gains in connectivity and contribute to achieving the goals of the plan. To develop theories of change, the planning team made explicit assumptions for each strategy to clarify the rationale used for undertaking actions and provided an opportunity for feedback on invalid assumptions or missing opportunities. The theories of change are results oriented and clearly define the expected outcome. The following Theories of Change models were developed by the WCRP planning team to “map” the causal (“if-then”) progression of assumptions of how the actions within a strategy work together to achieve project goals.
