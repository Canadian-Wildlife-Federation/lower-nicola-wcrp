## Horsefly River Watershed Barrier Prioritization Summary {-}

The primary conservation outcome of the WCRP will be the remediation of barriers to connectivity in the Horsefly River watershed. To achieve Goal 1 in this plan, it is necessary to prioritize and identify a suite of barriers that, if remediated, will provide access to a minimum of `r gain` km of spawning or rearing habitat (@tbl-table16):


```{python echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-table16
#| tbl-cap: "Spawning and rearing habitat connectivity gain requirements to meet WCRP goals in the Horsefly River watershed. The measures of currently accessible and total habitat values are derived from the Intrinsic Potential habitat model described in Appendix B."

total = watershed_connectivity("ALL")[1] #total km in HORS
access = watershed_connectivity("ALL")[2]

                   "Currently accessible (km)":[str(access)],

The barrier prioritization analysis ranked barriers by the amount of habitat blocked to produce an "intermediate barrier list" comprising more barriers than are needed to achieve the goals. A longer list of barriers is needed due to the inherent assumptions in the connectivity model, habitat model, and gaps in available data. Barriers that have been modelled (i.e., points where streams and road/rail networks intersect) are assumed to be barriers until field verification is undertaken and structures that have been assessed as "potential" barriers (e.g., may be passable at certain flow levels or for certain life history stages) require further investigation before a definitive remediation decision is made. Additionally, the habitat model identifies stream segments that have the potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for target species but does not attempt to quantify habitat quality or suitability (see Appendix B), which will require additional field verification once barrier assessments have completed. As such, the intermediate list of barriers below (@tbl-deficient) should be considered as a starting point in the prioritization process and represents structures that are a priority to evaluate further through barrier assessment and habitat confirmations because some structures will likely be passable, others will not be associated with usable habitat, and others may not be feasible to remediate because of logistic considerations. The intermediate barrier list was updated following the barrier assessments and habitat confirmations that were undertaken during the 2021 field season - some barriers were moved forward to the "priority barrier list" (see @tbl-priority) and others were eliminated from consideration due to one or more of the considerations discussed above (see @tbl-remove). The priority barrier list represents structures that were confirmed to be partial or full barriers to fish passage and that block access to confirmed habitat. Barriers on the priority list were reviewed by planning team members and selected for inclusion for proactive pursual of remediation.  For more details on the barrier prioritization model, please see @Mazany-Wright2021-rz.
