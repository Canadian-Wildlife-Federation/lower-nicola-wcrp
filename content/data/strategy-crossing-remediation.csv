ID,Actions,Details,Feasibility,Impact,Effectiveness
2.1,Remove and decommission barriers,,High,Very high,Effective
2.2,Upgrade and resize crossings,"Examples include installing larger culverts, replacing closed- with open-bottom culverts, or upgrading from culverts to bridges.",Very high,High,Effective
2.3,Install and maintain temporary mitigation,This strategy entails retrofitting structures to provide passage until the structure can be replaced or decommissioned.,Medium,High,Need more information
2.4,Initiate a barrier owner outreach program,"This can include reaching out to the Cattleman's Association, as well as potentially working with producers to adapt water-management practices. The outputs and materials generated could be exported outside the watershed to assist other watershed organizations with landowner engagement as well.",High,Medium,Need more information
2.5,Request regulatory action for non-compliant crossings,"Request provincial and federal agencies to require that targeted, high-priority barriers be remediated.",High,High,Effective
2.6,Knowledge Gap: Identify barriers and map barrier ownership,,High,Very high,Effective
2.7,Knowledge Gap: Continue updating the structure prioritization model,"The model process will be finalized, and priorities will be updated as new information becomes available. ",Very high,Very high,Very effective
2.8,Knowledge Gap: Adapt the provincial fish passage framework to account for ephemeral habitat,Ephemeral habitat is especially important in the Lower Nicola River and need to be accounted for in habitat surveys and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.,High,Very high,Effective
2.9,Knowledge Gap: Assess barriers by applying an adapted version of the provincial fish passage framework,"The first three steps are, (1) barrier assessments, (2) habitat confirmations (including of ephemeral habitat), and (3) rehabillitation designs.",High,Very high,Effective
