Kwinshatin Creek,Colddwater Road,ASSESSED,BARRIER,ROAD,0,0.43,Habitat confirmation,Recommend removal from list OR advance to design,CWF,No suitable spawning habitat is present for salmon - only a couple of gravel pockets (<1 m² and ~20% fines) usable for RB opportunistic spawning were observed. No overwintering habitat was noted in the surveyed section. RB is common with sizes 70 - 200 mm. One fish exhibited hybridization characteristics with CT (large mandible and heavy spotting). Moderate habitat value for RB.

The debris jam ~70 m downstream is no longer a fish barrier. In the last two years, water flows caused downcutting under the jam and side channels around, passable to CO, ST, and RB at higher flows. The stream is passable to adult fish from the mouth. Only RB was captured in the stream. Moderate habitat value for RB and Important Migratory Corridor for CO and ST."
