1.1,"Remediate dykes, berms, and other lateral barriers","The group selected a feasibility rating of High based on the assumption that our focus will be on smaller and cheaper projects, such as reconnecting ephemeral habitat and maintenance around the railroad dyke to reconnect wetland habitat.",High,Very high,Effective
1.2,Remediate natural barriers to lateral connectivity,"This can include various methods, such as beaver dam analogues.",High,Very high,Effective
1.3,Knowledge Gap: Improve mapping of lateral habitat and thermal refugia,Thermal imagery collected via drones could be used to map thermal refugia.,High,High,Effective
1.4,Knowledge Gap: Revisit previous remediation and off-channel habitat creation projects to assess whether they are still fish-passable,,Very high,Very high,Very effective
1.5,"Review LiDAR, aerial imagery, and field assessments to determine immediate lateral connectivity needs.",,Very high,Very high,Very effective
