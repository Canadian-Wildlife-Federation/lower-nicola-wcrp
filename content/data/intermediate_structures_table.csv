1011303627,Midday Creek,,POTENTIAL,ROAD,5,0,1.45,Barrier assessment,Recommend removal from list,Culvert is a barrier but habitat not suitable for salmonids (though 1 rainbow trout captured),Organic bed likely leads to oxygen depletion in summer. Slow flows through summer. Abundant sucker presence
1011300797,Midday Creek,,POTENTIAL,ROAD,6,0,0.18,Barrier assessment,Recommend removal from list,Crossing scores as a barrier but contains low quality rearing habitat suitable for Rainbow Trout only; no spawning or overwintering habitat. ,
197015,Midday Creek,ASSESSED,BARRIER,ROAD,7,0,2.8,Habitat confirmation,Recommend removal from list,Crossing scores as a barrier but contains low quality rearing habitat suitable for Rainbow Trout only; no spawning or overwintering habitat. ,
197036,Midday Creek,HABITAT CONFIRMATION,BARRIER,ROAD,8,0,1.91,Habitat confirmation,Recommend removal from list,Crossing scores as a barrier but has moderate quality habitat suitable for Rainbow Trout only.,
196969,Murray Lk Creek,ASSESSED,BARRIER,ROAD,,0,3.03,Habitat confirmation,Recommend advancing to priority list,"Confirmed barrier, excellent groundwater-influenced wetlands for Coho rearing upstream",Major contribution of sediments from road/culvert impacting 200 m of spawning channel immediately downstream of culvert.
197880 (1011301738),Stumbles Creek,ASSESSED,BARRIER,ROAD,0,0,0.27,Barrier assessment,Remove from list or advance to priority list,Partial barrier,"Passable to CO fry at low flows and adult fish at all flows. The calculated water velocity is 0.23 m/s. CO fry, and L was captured.  Important Migratory Corridor for CO."
197882 (1011304215a),Stumbles Creek,ASSESSED,BARRIER,ROAD,1,No,2,Barrier assessment,Assess juv passage: determine spring freshet velocities,Partial barrier,"Passable to CO fry at low flows and adult fish at all flows. The calculated water velocity is 0.26 m/s. CO fry, and RB parr captured. Important Migratory Corridor for CO."
197883 (1011301843),Stumbles Creek,ASSESSED,BARRIER,ROAD,2,0,0.2,Barrier assessment,Assess juv passage: determine spring freshet velocities,Partial barrier,"Passable to CO fry at low flows and adult fish at all flows. The calculated water velocity is 0.22 m/s. CO fry captured.  Water is diverted upstream of Hwy 8 for irrigation purposes during the growing season and regulated by a manual irrigation gate. Most water was diverted during the assessment. In the fall, Mr. Miller (the property owner where the culvert is located) opens the gate to allow CO to spawn in the stream on his property. Important Migratory Corridor for CO."
197884 (1011300751),Stumbles Creek,ASSESSED,BARRIER,ROAD,3,0,1.79,Barrier assessment,Assess juv passage: determine spring freshet velocities,Partial barrier,Passable to CO fry at low flows and adult fish at all flows. The calculated water velocity is 0.07 m/s. CO fry captured. Water is diverted upstream of Hwy 8 for irrigation purposes during the growing season and regulated by a manual irrigation gate. Most water was diverted during the assessment. Mr. Miller observed CO spawning upstream of Hwy 8 after the gate was opened in the fall. Important Migratory Corridor for CO.
197039,Kwinshatin Creek,ASSESSED,BARRIER,ROAD,0,0,2.2,Habitat confirmation,Advance to priority list or remove from consideration,Good Rainbow Trout stream with limited spawning potential for salmon,No suitable spawning habitat is present for salmon - only a couple of gravel pockets (<1 m² and ~20% fines) usable for RB opportunistic spawning were observed. No overwintering habitat was noted in the surveyed section. RB is common with sizes 70 - 200 mm. One fish exhibited hybridization characteristics with CT (large mandible and heavy spotting). Moderate habitat value for RB.
