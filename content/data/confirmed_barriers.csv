No outlet pool and 0.11 m drop onto rocks likely an impediment to both juveniles and adults. The calculated water velocity is 0.07 m/s. CO fry captured. Water is diverted upstream of Hwy 8 for irrigation purposes during the growing season and regulated by a manual irrigation gate. Most water was diverted during the assessment. Mr. Miller observed CO spawning upstream of Hwy 8 after the gate was opened in the fall.,http://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/pscismap/imageViewer.do?assessmentId=200143
