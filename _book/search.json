    "text": "Plan Purpose, Approach, and Scope\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a one-year collaborative planning effort, including action implementation, for the Lower Nicola River watershed, the overall aim of which is to build collaborative partnerships within the watershed to reduce the threat of aquatic barriers to migratory fish and the livelihoods that they support. This 10-year plan was developed to identify priority strategies that the Lower Nicola River WCRP planning team (see Table 1) for a list of team members) proposes to undertake between 2021-2031 to conserve and restore fish passage in the watershed, through lateral and thermal barrier rehabilitation, crossing rehabilitation, and barrier prevention strategies.\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative geographical information systems (GIS) analyses to gain a shared understanding of where restoration efforts will have the greatest benefit for migratory fish. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of fish and fish habitat conservation and restoration work in the Lower Nicola watershed that this WCRP builds upon and aims to compliment over the length of the plan. This includes work undertaken by the Scw’exmx Tribal Council and the five member or affiliate nations, the Nicola Watershed Governance Project, the Nicola Basin Collaborative, and the Risk Assessment Methodology for Salmon (RAMS). The planning team will aim to work with the Nicola Watershed Governance Project and the Nicola Basin Collaborative to promote coordination, decision-making, and implementation related to this plan.\nThe planning team compiled existing location and assessment data for structures, habitat data, and previously identified priorities in the watershed, and combined this with local and Indigenous knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve freshwater connectivity. To expand on this work, the Lower Nicola River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify the portions of the watershed where connectivity restoration efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected focal species, assessed their current connectivity status in the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, and developed a list of priority barriers for rehabilitation for further field investigation to achieve those goals. Field assessments were completed for 28 longitudinal barriers on the preliminary barrier list and 12 lateral barriers that were Identified by the Scw’exmc Tribal Council and Richard Bailey during the summer of 2021, followed by a series of WCRP Update Workshops in spring 2021. The aim of these workshops was for the team to receive updates on progress made during the field season, review assessment results and identify priority barriers for rehabilitation, revise the connectivity status assessment and goals, and update the Operational Plan for 2022. While the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snap-shot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the results presented in this plan to continuously improve the practice of aquatic barrier rehabilitation for migratory fish in the Lower Nicola River Watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright, Noseworthy, et al. (2021).",

    "text": "Project Scope\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The primary geographic scope - the Lower Nicola River watershed, excluding the Guichon Creek drainage and the Nicola River and Quilchena Creek drainages upstream of Nicola Lake\n\n\nThe primary geographic scope of this WCRP is the Lower Nicola River watershed, located in the Thompson drainage basin of the Fraser River system in south-central British Columbia drainage area 376,064 ha; (Figure 1). The scope constitutes the Lower Nicola “watershed group” as defined by the British Columbia Freshwater Atlas (FWA), which excludes the Guichon Creek drainage and the Nicola River and Quilchena Creek drainages upstream of Nicola Lake. A consistent spatial framework was necessary to undertake a watershed-selection process at the provincial scale to identify target watersheds to improve freshwater connectivity for salmonids. The Lower Nicola River watershed was identified by the B.C. Fish Passage Restoration Initiative as one of four target watersheds for WCRP development (Mazany-Wright, Norris, et al. (2021b)). Culturally and economically important populations of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawtyscha), Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and the anadromoius life history of Rainvow Trout commonly referred as steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are all found in the watershed, which historically supported Indigenous sustenance and trading economies (Table 1; L. N. I. Band (2015), E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019), C. Band (2021)).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Focal species in the Lower Nicola River watershed. The Nłeʔkepmxcín\n(Nlaka’pamuxcin), nqilxʷcn (nsyilxcən), and Western common and\nscientific species names are provided.

The Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx and Syilx peoples steward the land and the waters of the Lower Nicola River watershed. The planning team will pursue early, meaningful, and continued engagement with First Nations communities involved in work and projects related to this plan. It will be necessary to receive permission from the communities for any work to occur on their territory.\nThe primary geographic scope of this WCRP was further refined by identifying “naturally accessible” waterbodies, which are defined as waterbodies that focal species should be able to access in the absence of human-made barriers (Figure 2). Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated using fish species observation and distribution data, as well as data on “natural barriers”, which are waterfalls greater than 5 m in height, gradient barriers based on literature-derived; species-specific swimming abilities. “Watershed exclusion areas” were also identified, which are portions of the watershed where barrier rehabilitation efforts should not occur due to additional considerations. These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the constraints on naturally accessible waterbodies. The planning team identified a few tributaries to the mainstem Nicola River as watershed exclusion areas due to intermittent or insufficient flows to support restoring connectivity for the focal species, including Hamilton Creek and agricultural irrigation ditches just downstream of Nicola Lake Dam. Additionally, Stumplake Creek and Peter Hope Creek were identified as watershed exclusion areas due to the presence of invasive Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens). It is unclear whether existing structures located in these systems will be effective in preventing the downstream spread of Yellow Perch, but the planning team advised maintaining the structures for the time being. All waterbodies not identified as naturally accessible were removed from the project scope. The resulting constrained geographic scope formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling key habitat, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning (Mazany-Wright, Norris, et al. (2021a)).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Naturally accessible waterbodies within the Lower Nicola River watershed. These do not represent key habitat, but rather identify the waterbodies within which habitat modelling and barrier mapping and prioritization were undertaken.\n\n\nThe thematic scope of this WCRP is freshwater connectivity. Connectivity influences critical components of freshwater ecosystem structure and function, including aquatic species dispersal and migration, the transport of energy and matter (e.g., nutrient cycling and sediment flows), and temperature regulation (Seliger and Zeiringer (2018)). Though each of these factors are important when considering the health of a watershed, for the purposes of this WCRP the term “freshwater connectivity” is defined as the degree to which focal species can disperse or migrate freely through freshwater systems. Connectivity can be disrupted by physical structures in the longitudinal (i.e., upstream-downstream) and lateral (i.e., connectivity between the mainstem and adjacent wetlands, floodplains, side channels, and off-channel habitat) planes, including dams, weirs, stream crossings, dykes, linear infrastructure, and debris flows. Freshwater systems can also be disconnected by “physiological” barriers that prevent the free dispersal of species, including thermal (i.e., reaches where stream temperatures are too high) or flow (i.e., reaches where stream flow is insufficient to support the requirements of any life stage) barriers.\nThe broader Nicola basin is a temperature- and flow-sensitive watershed, and both factors significantly affect connectivity for fish species in the Lower Nicola (E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019), Forests (2018)). The changing thermal regime of the Lower Nicola River watershed is a growing concern, with two scales of thermal impacts occurring within the watershed — watershed-scale changes in thermal regimes and localized barriers preventing access to thermal refugia.\nThe watershed-scale changes to the thermal regime are linked to several landscape-scale drivers including increases in water withdrawals, changes in land use, deforestation (due to resource extraction and mountain pine beetle infestations), and climate change, which are exacerbated by subsequent changes to channel-forming processes (E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019)). These changes have created resulted in major wildfires and flooding occurring in 2017, 2020 and 2021, which have in turn accelerated changes to channel-forming processes, flows, and stream temperatures. Thermal barriers that prevent access to headwater reaches from the mainstem channels form annually along the valley floor. This has resulted in the adaptation of an early-migrant Chinook Salmon population, which uses the upper portions of Spius Creek and tributaries and the upper reaches of the Coldwater River, where access to the spawning grounds requires passing through the lower sections before the stream temperatures create physiological thermal barriers. These returning adults pass through the lower reaches in May and June as the freshet starts to abate, then hold in deeper pools for two months until they spawn in mid-to-late August (R. Bailey, Nooaitch Band, pers. comm.).\nLocalized thermal disconnectivity in the lateral dimension occurs when rearing and out-migrating juveniles are unable to access side-channel and off-channel thermal refugia and holding pools due to changing channel processes exacerbated by upland management and the development of linear infrastructure including dykes, roads, railways, and trails. These groundwater-serviced habitats provide thermal refuge for juvenile fish in the watershed; and can also provide critical refuge for returning spawners. When these lateral refugia become disconnected from mainstem channels, lethal stream temperatures can cause juvenile die-offs. Activities that restore and protect connectivity to these lateral refugia, particularly those cooled by groundwater sources, can help mitigate thermal disconnectivity in the watershed.\nMitigation of the landscape-scale drivers of changes to thermal regimes are outside of the scope of this plan. Although vital for the long-term resilience of the watershed, the broad land-use patterns, over-subscription of water withdrawals, and climate change that are causing chronic thermal issues in the watershed require more complex, coordinated, and resource-intensive solutions than this planning process can provide. This plan is intended to focus on the direct rehabilitation and prevention of localized, physical barriers to lateral thermal refugia and longitudinal connectivity to maintain fish passage to spawning, rearing, and refuge habitat. Lateral– and associated thermal– connectivity was identified by the planning team as the primary connectivity concern in the watershed within the defined scope of this plan."

    "section": "Focal species",
    "text": "Focal species\nFocal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved or restored in the watershed. In the Lower Nicola River watershed, the planning team selected anadromous salmonids as the focal guild, which comprises Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, and steelhead. The selection of these focal species was driven primarily by the focal species of the primary funds supporting this planning work. The planning team also identified other culturally and ecologically important species within the watershed to consider for inclusion in future iterations of the WCRP, including kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka), Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Mountain Whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni), Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), Burbot (Lota lota), and Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha).\n\nAnadromous Salmonids\nAnadromous salmonids are cultural and ecological keystone species that contribute to productive ecosystems by contributing marine-derived nutrients to the watershed and forming an important food source for bears and other species (Schindler and Quay. (2003)). Salmon and steelhead have enduring food, social, and ceremonial value for First Nations in the Lower Nicola River watershed – having sustained life, trading economies, and culture for the Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx and Syilx peoples since time immemorial (L. N. I. Band (2015), E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019), C. Band (2021)). The harvest and processing of these species have helped pass knowledge and ceremony to future generations (Council (n.d.), L. N. I. Band (2015)).\nAnadromous salmonid populations in the Lower Nicola River watershed have declined significantly since the mid-1980s, leading First Nation communities to voluntarily reduce their harvest (E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019)). The Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx and Syilx peoples have always been stewards of the lands, resources, and fisheries in their traditional territories through an interconnected relationship based on respect and reverence, captured by the Syilx concept of Tmixw – the people only take the salmon that is needed (L. N. I. Band (2015), E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019), U. N. Band (2021)). The stewardship of their waters continues through the work of the Scw’exmx Tribal Council and its four member communities, the Lower Nicola Indian Band, and initiatives like the Nicola Watershed Governance Project. The Chinook Salmon (Endangered), Coho Salmon (Threatened), and steelhead (Endangered) populations have all been assessed and proposed for Species at Risk Act listing by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). The development and implementation of this WCRP aims to support ongoing conservation and restoration work by the Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx, Syilx, and other local groups by providing an action plan to address the specific, tractable conservation threat posed by fragmentation, and conserving habitat connectivity for these important species.\n\n\nChinook Salmon | k’ʷy’íʔe/pəqéłus | Oncorhynchus tshawytscha\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Chinook Salmon Designated Unit assessment in the Lower Nicola River\nwatershed.

The population has been in decline since the mid-1990s (L. Ltd. (2007), E. Ltd. (2017)). Known and historic spawning locations include the mainstem Nicola River (mostly between the Coldwater River and Spius Creek confluences), Coldwater River, Spius Creek, lower portions of Clapperton Creek, and upstream of Nicola Lake in Moore Creek and the Upper Nicola River (L. Ltd. (2007), E. Ltd. (2017)). In addition to these spawning locations, important juvenile rearing areas have been observed in Juliet Creek and Voght Creek (L. Ltd. (2007)). Chinook Salmon stocks have been supplemented by the Spius Creek hatchery since the 1980s. Fry and smolt releases have both occurred, and the Nicola stock is currently enhanced by ~200,000 coded-wire-tagged yearling smolts released annually as a component of the Pacific Salmon Commission indicator stock study program (R. Bailey, pers. comm.).\n\n\nCoho Salmon | sx̣a̓yqs | Oncorhynchus kisutch\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Coho Salmon Designated Unit assessment in the Lower Nicola River\nwatershed.

The population has been in decline since the mid1980s (DFO 1999, E. Ltd. (2017)). Coho Salmon stocks have been supplemented in recent decades by outplants from the Spius Creek Hatchery (E. Ltd. (2017)). The majority of Coho Salmon spawning and rearing occurs in the Coldwater River, Spius Creek, and Maka Creek, but has also been observed in Clapperton Creek, Prospect Creek, and the Upper Nicola River and Moore Creek (L. Ltd. (2007), PSF 2020). The lower reaches of many smaller tributaries are also important Coho Salmon rearing habitat.\n\n\nSteelhead | cóʕʷłeʔ | Oncorhynchus mykiss\n\n\n\n\nTable 4:  Steelhead Designated Unit assessment in the Lower Nicola River\nwatershed.

Steelhead spawning and rearing is known to occur in the lower portion of the mainstem Nicola River, Skuhun Creek, Shakan Creek, Nuaitch Creek, Maka Creek, Coldwater River, Juliet Creek, Voght Creek, Prospect Creek, and Clapperton Creek (L. Ltd. (2007)). Historically, almost all third-order and greater streams would have supported steelhead, and groundwater-fed thermal refugia continue to provide important rearing and holding habitats (E. Ltd. (2017))."

    "text": "Structure Types\nTable 5 highlights structure types threatening anadromous salmonids in the watershed. The results of this assessment were used to inform the subsequent planning steps; and identify knowledge gaps where there are limited spatial data to inform the assessment for a specific structure type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Structure types in the Lower Nicola River watershed and barrier rating assessment results. For each structure type listed, ‘Extent’ refers to the proportion of key habitat for all focal species that is being blocked by that structure type, ‘Severity’ is the proportion of structures for each structure type that are known to block passage for focal species based on field assessments, and ‘Irreversibility’ is the degree to which the effects of a structure type can be reversed and connectivity restored. Key habitat for the purpose of this exercise is defined as the total amount of combined thermal refuge, spawning, and rearing habitat.\n\n\nStructure Types\nExtent\nSeverity\nIrreversibility\nOverall Threat Rating:\n\n\n\n\nLateral Barriers (including to thermal connectivity)\nHigh\nVery High\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\nNatural Barriers\nHigh\nVery High\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\nRoad-Stream Crossings\nVery High\nLow\nLow\nMedium\n\n\nSmall Dams(&lt;5m height)\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nLow\n\n\nAbandoned Rail-stream Crossings (longitudinal)\nLow\nLow\nMedium\nLow\n\n\nTrail-stream Crossings\nLow\nLow\nLow\nLow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLateral Barriers (Including to thermal connectivity)\nThere are numerous lateral barrier types that potentially occur in the watershed, including dykes, berms, and linear development (i.e., roads and abandoned rail lines), all of which can restrict the ability of anadromous salmonids to move into floodplains, riparian wetlands, off-channel habitats, and other groundwater-fed thermal refugia. No comprehensive lateral barrier dataset exists within the watershed, so pressure ratings were based on qualitative local knowledge. Lateral barriers were identified as the primary connectivity concern in the watershed due to a High extent for all focal species’ habitats and a Very High severity of barriers (i.e., almost all structures that exist on key habitat arewill blocking the movement of fish). Highway 5, Highway 8, and the two abandoned rail lines run along significant stretches of the Coldwater River and mainstem Nicola River and likely disconnect these mainstems from segments of their historic floodplains, off-channel habitats, and thermal refugia in certain locations. Other lateral barriers include irrigation infrastructure that occurs in the valley bottom on agricultural land. Overall, the planning team decided that a High overall threat rating captured the effect that lateral barriers are likely having on connectivity in the watershed, - particularly thermal connectivity- while recognizing that the lack of data on lateral barriers in the watershed is an important knowledge gap to fill.\n\n\nNatural Barriers\nNatural barriers to fish passage can include debris flows, log jams, and sediment deposits, etc., but natural features that have always restricted fish passage (e.g., waterfalls) are not considered under this structure type. Natural barriers are difficult to include in a spatial prioritization framework due to their transient nature. The planning team felt that the major drivers of natural barriers were massive sediment aggradation that has occurred in the watershed in recent years due to changes in the natural flow regime of the watershed. The associated channel destabilization creates impassable stream segments due to a lack of flow and increased lateral migration of streams. The extent, severity, and passability of these obstacles will vary over time depending on the season and year; however, current and historic land-use practices, including forest harvesting, agriculture, and water withdrawals, have exacerbated the effect of natural barriers in the watershed. Due to the nature of these land-use practices, the severity of natural barriers was rated as Very High and the irreversibility as Medium, the latter due to the effort required to rectify poor land-use practices at a watershed scale. Overall, the planning team felt that a threat rating of ‘High’ adequately captured the effects of natural barriers.\n\n\nRoad-stream Crossings\nRoad-stream crossings are an abundant structure type in the watershed, with 80 assessed and modelled crossings located on modelled anadromous salmonid habitat. Demographic road crossings (highways, municipal, and paved roads) may disconnect up to 55.39 km of habitat (57.4% of the total estimated disconnected habitat), with 88% of assessed crossings having been identified as barriers to fish passage. Resource roads disconnect 34.04 km of habitat (35.3%), with 73% of assessed crossings identified as barriers. Significant land use and linear development throughout the valley bottom has disconnected the Nicola River from important habitat in some tributaries, including Highway 5 and Highway 8. The extent of road-stream crossings was given a rating of Very High, though the collective experience and input from the planning team resulted in Low severity and irreversibility ratings due to the existing body of knowledge and resources to support the rehabilitation of road-stream crossings, though it was noted that there is significant variability between resource roads and highway crossings. The overall threat rating for road-stream crossings was given a rating of Medium.\n\n\nSmall Dams (&lt;5m height)\nThere are five mapped dams on modelled anadromous salmonid habitat in the watershed, potentially disconnecting a combined 5.08 km (5.3%) of spawning and rearing habitat, resulting in a Low extent. The extent rating of these structures was confirmed by the planning team. There are three known fish passage structures in the watershed, including on Nicola Lake Dam, and the remaining dams likely block passage for anadromous salmonids. Many dams in the watershed are irrigation impoundments that are of little consequence to focal species. Rehabilitating dams requires significant resources; however, due to the minimal extent of dams in the watershed, a final pressure rating of Low was assigned to this structure type.\n\n\nTrail-stream Crossings\nThere is very little spatial data available on trail-stream crossings in the watershed, so the planning team was unable to quantify the true Extent and Severity of this structure type. However, the planning team felt that trail-stream crossings are not prevalent within the watershed and that, where they do exist, they do not significantly impact passage for anadromous salmon. As most crossings will be fords or similar structures, rehabilitation may not be required, or rehabilitation costs associated with these barriers would be quite low. Overall, the planning team felt that the pressure rating for trail-stream crossings was likely Low; however, the lack of ground-truthed evidence to support this rating was identified as a knowledge gap within this plan.\n\n\nSmall Dams (&lt;5m height)\nThere are five mapped dams on modelled anadromous salmonid habitat in the watershed, blocking a combined 5.08 km (5.3%) of spawning and rearing habitat, resulting in a Low extent see barrier prioritization for dams included in the intermediate barrier list. The extent rating of these structures was confirmed by the planning team. There are three known fish passage structures in the watershed, including on Nicola Lake Dam, and the remaining dams likely block passage for anadromous salmonids. Many dams in the watershed are irrigation impoundments that are of little consequence to focal species. Rehabilitating dams requires significant resources; however, due to the minimal extent of dams in the watershed, a final pressure rating of Low was assigned to this structure type.\n\n\nAbandoned Rail-Stream Crossings (Longitudinal)\nThere are no active rail lines in the Lower Nicola watershed; however, infrastructure remains in place from the historic Nicola Valley Railway and the Kettle Valley Railway, and some of the old rail lines have been converted to trails. There are 4 modelled abandoned rail-stream crossings located on modelled key habitat, potentially blocking a combined 1.94 km of habitat (2.01% of the total habitat disconnectedblocked; see barrier-prioritization for abandoned rail-stream crossings included in the intermediate barrier list). There are no data to support the assessment of the severity of these crossings, but the collective knowledge of the planning team resulted in a Low severity rating because most are believed to be serviced by bridges or open-bottom structures. Despite the moderate technical knowledge and resources required to rehabilitate these barriers, the low extent and low severity resulted in a Low overall threat rating. The abandoned rail lines, however, were identified by the planning team as a contributor to lateral and thermal disconnectivity in the watershed (see Lateral Barriers to Thermal Connectivity).\n\n\nTrail-Stream Crossings (Longitudinal)\nThere are very little spatial data available on trail-stream crossings in the watershed, so the planning team was unable to quantify the true extent and severity of this structure type. However, the planning team felt that trail-stream crossings are not prevalent within the watershed and that where they do exist, they do not significantly restrict passage for anadromous salmonids. Because most crossings will likely be fords or similar structures, the rehabilitation costs associated with these barriers would be quite low. Overall, the planning team felt that the overall threat rating for trail-stream crossings was likely Low.\n\n\n\n\nBand, Coldwater. 2021. “Our Nlaka’pamux History.” Coldwater Band.\n\n\nBand, Lower Nicola Indian. 2015. “Community Profile.” Lower Nicola Indian Band.\n\n\nBand, Upper Nicola. 2021. “About Upper Nicola Band.” Upper Nicola Band.\n\n\nCouncil, Fraser Basin. n.d.

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment\nThe planning team identified three Key Ecological Attributes (KEAs) and associated indicators to assess the current connectivity status of the watershed for each focal species: Accessible Off-channel Thermal Refuge, Accessible Spawning Habitat, and Accessible Rearing Habitat. KEAs are the key aspects of anadromous salmonid habitat that are being targeted by this WCRP. For each KEA, an associated indicator was assigned to measure the status of that KEA. The connectivity status indicators were used to establish goals to improve key habitat connectivity over time, and are the baseline against which progress is tracked over time.\nThe current connectivity status was estimated using three spatial models:\n\nAccessibility model: Naturally accessible waterbodies are those that are considered likely accessible to focal species if no human-made barriers existed on the landscape. These were spatially delineated for each focal species using natural barriers (i.e., waterfalls, gradient barriers, or subsurface flows) that would naturally limit upstream movement.\nHabitat model: A subset of the naturally accessible waterbody layer was defined as key habitat, i.e., habitat likely to support spawning or rearing, rather than simply movement corridors. The habitat model identifies areas within waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream channel gradient and discharge. The habitat model criteria can be found in (Table 1).\nConnectivity model: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). Key habitat with no structures or only passable structures downstream was considered connected. Key habitat upstream of full, partial, or potential barriers was considered disconnected. All connected habitat was summed and divided by the total amount of key habitat in the watershed to arrive at the KEA indicators.

    "text": "Longitudinal Field Assessment Ranking Process\nA primary outcome of the WCRP will be the rehabilitation of barriers to connectivity in the Lower Nicola River Watershed. To achieve the goals in this plan, it is necessary to identify a set of structures that, if rehabilitated, will provide access to a minimum of 52.38 km of rearing habitat (Table 2):\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Rearing habitat connectivity gain requirements to meet WCRP goals in the Lower Nicola River watershed.

The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. This process, combined with input from local knowledge holders and experts, is used to develop field plans for assessing structures that have the potential to block the most key habitat in the watershed. Field assessments are based on the BC Fish Passage Strategic Approach and can include a barrier assessment (i.e., evaluating passability of the structure), a habitat confirmation (i.e., evaluation of whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species and whether there are other undocumented anthropogenic or natural barriers upstream or downstream), or a detailed habitat investigation (e.g., a fish passage study or further in-depth analysis of habitat features in a waterbody). The ranking process accounts for the long-term and immediate potential habitat gains potentially offered by each structure to identify structures that maximize long-term and immediate potential to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) are ranked in each iteration of the ranking process. Details of the ranking process used to guide field assessments can be found in Appendix B.",

Depending on the barrier, owner, financial constraints, and quality of upstream habitat, the action may be to leave to end of life cycle before reviewing again, remove and decommission the road, replace with a new passable structure, or modify to temporarily restore connectivity (e.g., fish ladder or baffles installed; see Table 3).\nAssessed structures that remain data deficient list – some form of field assessment has been completed on the structure, but further investigation is required to confirm either the passability status or presence/suitability of upstream habitat (see Table 4).\nRehabilitated barriers list – priority barriers that have been addressed (either through removal, replacement, or temporary fish passage improvement projects; see Table 5)\nNon-actionable barriers list – the structure is confirmed to be a barrier to fish passage and have some amount/quality of habitat upstream, but the planning team will not identify actions to advance rehabilitation of the structure because of logistic considerations (e.g., financial costs), short habitat gain, or the upstream habitat is of poor quality or unsuitable in its present condition to support key life stages of the focal species Appendix C.\nExcluded structures list – the structure is excluded from further consideration in subsequent ranking and work planning because the structure is confirmed passable (e.g., bridge), not present, or there is no key habitat upstream Appendix C.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Confirmed barriers\n\n\nBarrier IdModelled Crossing IdWatercourse NameRoad NameStructure TypePartial PassabilityStructure OwnerNum Barriers SetTotal Hab Gain SetUpstream Habitat QualityEstimated Cost $Next StepsReasonNotesSupporting Links19696911304548Murray Lake CreekMaka-Murray/Maka-Michael JCTStream crossing - CBSFLNRO12.87150000Post-rehabilitation monitoringActive Coho spawning and rearing streamCulvert and road are a significant sediment source to stream197882Stumbles CreekUnnamedStream crossing - CBSYesPrivate32.25High150000Engage with partnersImportant migratory corridor for Coho.

    "text": "Strategies & Actions\nIn 2021, the Lower Nicola River watershed and many other parts of BC experienced devastating forest fires and floods. Prior to this, CWF worked with the Scw’exmx Tribal Council to assess high-ranking structures and undertake preliminary assessments of potential lateral barriers identified by local experts and knowledge holders. Recognizing that there may be other urgent restoration priorities in the watershed, the Planning Team decided that the areas of focus over the short term would be on reviewing LiDAR (light detection and ranging), aerial imagery, and field assessments to determine immediate lateral connectivity needs (see Action 1.5 below), responding to new barriers that may have developed in the watershed following the atmospheric river event, and addressing other emerging needs in the watershed. The Planning Team began focusing on the remaining strategies and actions in the table below Table 1 in 2023.\nThe planning team identified five broad strategies to implement through this WCRP: (1) lateral barrier rehabilitation (priority on reconnecting thermal refugia), (2) stream crossing rehabilitation, (3) dam rehabilitation, (4) barrier prevention, and (5) partner development. Individual actions were qualitatively evaluated based on the anticipated effect each action will have on realizing on-the-ground gains in connectivity. Effectiveness ratings are based on a combination of “Feasibility” and “Impact.” Feasibility is defined as the degree to which the project team can implement the action within realistic constraints (financial, time, ethical, etc.), and Impact is the degree to which the action is likely to contribute to achieving one or more of the goals established in this plan."

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods\nThe connectivity status assessment for anadromous salmonids in the Lower Nicola River watershed builds on existing connectivity modelling work undertaken by the BC Fish Passage Technical Working Group, resulting in a flexible, customizable open-source spatial model called “bcfishpass”. The model spatially locates known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identifies potential spawning and rearing habitat for focal species, and estimates the amount of habitat that is currently accessible to focal species. The model uses an adapted version of the Intrinsic Potential (IP) fish habitat modelling framework (see Sheer et al. (2009) for an overview of the IP framework). The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each focal species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, please see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021). The variables and thresholds used to model potential spawning and rearing habitat for each focal species are summarized in Table 1. The quantity of modelled habitat for each species was aggregated for each habitat type and represents a linear measure of potential habitat. To recognize the rearing value provided by features represented by polygons for certain species (e.g., wetlands for Coho Salmon and lakes for Sockeye Salmon) a multiplier of 1.5x the length of the stream segments flowing through the polygons was applied.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Parameters and thresholds used to inform the Intrinsic Potential habitat model for spawning and rearing habitat for each focal species in the Lower Nicola River watershed.\n\n\nSpecies Spawning Habitat Channel Gradient (%) Spawning Habitat Mean annual discharge (m3/s) Rearing Habitat Channel Gradient (%) Rearing Habitat Mean annual discharge (m3/s) Rearing Habitat Multiplier (1.5x) Chinook Salmon 0-3 [1] [2]0.46-322.5 [3][4][5][6][7]0-5 [5][8]0.28-100 [9]N/A Coho Salmon 0-5 [6][10]0.164-59.15 [3][4][5][10][11]0-5 [8][12]0.03-40 [9][13]Wetland Steelhead 0-4 [2][15]0.447-75 [3][4][6]0-7.4 [8]0.02-60 [9][13]N/A \n\n\n\nReferences: [1] Busch et al.

    "text": "Acknowledgements\nThis plan is the culmination of a collaborative planning process undertaken in the Lower Nicola River watershed over many months with a team of individuals and groups that are passionate about the conservation and restoration of freshwater ecosystems and the species they support. Plan development was funded by the BC Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund, Canada Nature Fund for Aquatic Species at Risk, and the RBC Bluewater Project. We were fortunate to benefit from the feedback, guidance, and wisdom of people who volunteered their time throughout this process — this publication would not have been possible without the engagement of our partners and the planning team (see Table 1).\nThe Canadian Wildlife Federation recognizes that the lands and waters that form the basis of this plan are the traditional unceded territory of the Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx and Syilx peoples. We are grateful for the opportunity to learn from the stewards of this land and work together to benefit Pacific salmon and steelhead. A special thank you to the Lower Nicola Indian Band for sharing the traditional Nłeʔkepmxcín (Nlaka’pamuxcin) names used in this plan.\nWe recognize the incredibly rich history of fish and fish habitat conservation and restoration work that has occurred in the Lower Nicola River watershed to-date. A special thank you to Richard Bailey for providing background and contextual information on the myriad threats facing anadromous salmonid populations in the Lower Nicola. Thank you to Richard, Paul Mozin, Sarah Ostorforoff, and Tom Willms for identifying lateral barrier sites to assess during the 2021 field season. We are excited to continue partnering with local groups and organizations to build upon existing initiatives and provide a road map to push connectivity restoration forward over the next 10 years and beyond."

    "section": "Plan Purpose, Approach, and Scope",
    "text": "Plan Purpose, Approach, and Scope\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a one-year collaborative planning effort, including action implementation, for the Lower Nicola River watershed, the overall aim of which is to build collaborative partnerships within the watershed to reduce the threat of aquatic barriers to migratory fish and the livelihoods that they support. This 10-year plan was developed to identify priority strategies that the Lower Nicola River WCRP planning team (see Table 1) proposes to undertake between 2021-2031 to conserve and restore fish passage in the watershed, through lateral and thermal barrier rehabilitation, crossing rehabilitation, and barrier prevention strategies.\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative geographical information systems (GIS) analyses to gain a shared understanding of where restoration efforts will have the greatest benefit for migratory fish. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of fish and fish habitat conservation and restoration work in the Lower Nicola River watershed that this WCRP builds upon and aims to complement over the length of the plan. This includes work undertaken by the Scw’exmx Tribal Council and the four member or affiliate nations (Coldwater, Upper Nicola, Shackan and Nooaitch bands), the Lower Nicola Indian Band, the Nicola Watershed Governance Project including the Salmon Ecosystem Table and Nicola Restoration Committee, the Nicola Basin Collaborative, and the Risk Assessment Methodology for Salmon (RAMS). The planning team will aim to work with the Nicola Watershed Governance Project and the Nicola Basin Collaborative to promote coordination, decision-making, and implementation related to this plan.\nThe planning team compiled existing structure location and assessment data, habitat data, and previously identified priorities in the watershed, and combined this with local and Indigenous knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve freshwater connectivity. The Lower Nicola River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify the portions of the watershed where connectivity restoration efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected focal species, assessed the current key habitat connectivity status of the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, sundertook an iterative structure-ranking process to identify a list of priority barriers for rehabilitation to achieve those goals. Although the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snapshot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the results presented in this plan to continuously improve the practice of aquatic barrier rehabilitation for migratory fishes in the Lower Nicola River watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright, Noseworthy, et al. (2021)."
