    "text": "Plan Purpose, Approach, and Scope\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Remediation Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a one-year collaborative planning effort, including action implementation, for the Lower Nicola River watershed, the overall aim of which is to build collaborative partnerships within the watershed to reduce the threat of aquatic barriers to migratory fish and the livelihoods that they support. This 10-year plan was developed to identify priority strategies that the Lower Nicola River WCRP planning team see Planning Team for a list of team members proposes to undertake between 2021-2031 to conserve and restore fish passage in the watershed, through lateral and thermal barrier remediation, crossing remediation, and barrier prevention strategies.\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative GIS analyses to gain a shared understanding of where remediation efforts will have the greatest benefit for migratory fish. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of fish and fish habitat conservation and restoration work in the Lower Nicola watershed that this WCRP builds upon and aims to compliment over the length of the plan. This includes work undertaken by the Scw’exmx Tribal Council and the five member or affiliate nations (see Project Scope), the Nicola Watershed Governance Project, the Nicola Basin Collaborative, and the Risk Assessment Methodology for Salmon (RAMS). The planning team will aim to work with the Nicola Watershed Governance Project and the Nicola Basin Collaborative to promote coordination, decision-making, and implementation related to this plan.\nThe planning team compiled existing location and assessment data for potential barriers, habitat data, and previously identified priorities in the watershed, and combined this with local and Indigenous knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve connectivity. To expand on this work, the Lower Nicola River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify the portions of the watershed where connectivity remediation efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected target fish species, assessed their current connectivity status in the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, and developed a priority list of barriers for further field investigation to achieve those goals. Field assessments were completed for 28 longitudinal barriers on the preliminary barrier list and 12 lateral barriers that were Identified by the Scw’exmc Tribal Council and Richard Bailey during the summer of 2021, followed by a series of WCRP Update Workshops in spring 2021. The aim of these workshops was for the team to receive updates on progress made during the field season, review assessment results and identify priority barriers, revise the connectivity status assessment and goals, and update the Operational Plan for 2022. While the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snap-shot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the results presented in this plan to continuously improve the practice of aquatic barrier remediation for migratory fish in the Lower Nicola River Watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright, Noseworthy, et al. (2021)."

    "text": "Project Scope\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The primary geographic scope - the Lower Nicola River watershed, excluding the Guichon Creek drainage and the Nicola River and Quilchena Creek drainages upstream of Nicola Lake\n\n\nThe primary geographic scope of this WCRP is the Lower Nicola River watershed, located in the Thompson drainage basin of the Fraser River system in south-central British Columbia with a drainage area of 376,064 ha (Figure 1). The scope constitutes the Lower Nicola “watershed group” as defined by the British Columbia Freshwater Atlas (FWA), which excludes the Guichon Creek drainage and the Nicola River and Quilchena Creek drainages upstream of Nicola Lake. A consistent spatial framework was necessary to undertake a watershed-selection process at the provincial scale to identify target watershed to improve connectivity for salmonids. The Lower Nicola River watershed was identified by the BC Fish Passage Restoration Initiative as one of four target watersheds for WCRP development (Mazany-Wright, Norris, et al. (2021b)) Culturally and economically important populations of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawtyscha), Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are all found in the watershed, which historically supported Indigenous sustenance and trading economies (Table 1; L. N. I. Band (2015), E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019), C. Band (2021)).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Target fish species in the Lower Nicola River watershed. The\nNłeʔkepmxcín (Nlaka’pamuxcin), nqilxʷcn (nsyilxcən), and Western common\nand scientific species names are provided.

The Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx and Syilx peoples steward the land and the waters of the Lower Nicola River watershed. The planning team will pursue early, meaningful, and continued engagement with First Nations communities involved in work and projects related to this plan. It will be necessary to receive permission from the communities for any work to occur on their territory.\nThe geographic scope of this WCRP was further refined by identifying “potentially accessible” stream segments, which are defined as streams that target species should be able to access in the absence of anthropogenic barriers (Figure 2). Potentially accessible stream segments were spatially delineated using fish species observation and distribution data, as well as data on “exclusionary points”, which are waterfalls greater than 5 m in height, gradient barriers based on species-specific swimming abilities, and “watershed exclusion areas”, which are portions of the watershed where barrier remediation efforts should not occur. These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the constraints on potentially accessible stream segments. The planning team identified a few tributaries to the mainstem Nicola River as watershed exclusion areas due to intermittent or insufficient flows to support restoring connectivity for the target species, including Hamilton Creek and agricultural irrigation ditches just downstream of Nicola Lake Dam. Additionally, Stumplake Creek and Peter Hope Creek were identified as watershed exclusion areas due to the presence of invasive Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens). It is unclear whether existing barriers located in these systems will be effective in preventing the downstream spread of Yellow Perch, but the planning team advised maintaining the barriers for the time being. All stream segments not identified as potentially accessible were removed from the scope for further consideration. The resulting constrained geographic scope formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling useable habitat types, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning (Mazany-Wright, Norris, et al. (2021a)).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Potentially accessible stream segments within the Lower Nicola River watershed. These do not represent useable habitat types, but rather identify the stream segments within which habitat modelling and barrier mapping and prioritization was undertaken.\n\n\nThe thematic scope of this WCRP is freshwater connectivity. Connectivity is a critical component of freshwater ecosystems that encompasses a variety of factors related to ecosystem structure and function, such as the ability of aquatic organisms to disperse and/or migrate, the transportation of energy and matter (e.g., nutrient cycling and sediment flows), and temperature regulation (Seliger and Zeiringer (2018)). Though each of these factors are important when considering the health of a watershed, for the purposes of this WCRP the term “connectivity” is defined as the degree to which aquatic organisms can disperse and/or migrate freely through freshwater systems. Connectivity can be disrupted by physical barriers to connectivity in the longitudinal (i.e., upstream-downstream) and lateral (i.e., connectivity between the mainstem and adjacent wetlands, floodplains, side channels, and off-channel habitat) planes, including dams, weirs, stream crossings, dykes, linear infrastructure, waterfalls, and debris flows. Freshwater systems can also be disconnected by “physiological” barriers that prevent the free dispersal of species, including thermal (i.e., reaches where stream temperatures are too high) or flow (i.e., reaches where stream flow is insufficient to support the requirements of any life stage) barriers.\nThe broader Nicola basin has been designated as a temperature- and flow-sensitive watershed in British Columbia, and both factors significantly affect connectivity for fish species in the Lower Nicola (E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019), MFLNRORD 2018). The changing thermal regime of the Lower Nicola River watershed is a growing concern, with two scales of thermal disconnectivity occurring within the watershed — watershed-scale changes in thermal regimes and localized barriers preventing access to thermal refugia.\nThe watershed-scale changes to the thermal regime are linked to several landscape-scale drivers including increases in water withdrawals, changes in land use, deforestation (due to resource extraction and mountain pine beetle infestations), and climate change, which are exacerbated by subsequent changes to channel-forming processes (E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019)). These changes have created annual thermal barriers that prevent access to headwater reaches from the mainstem channels along the valley floor. This has resulted in the adaptation of an early-migrant Chinook Salmon population, which uses the upper portions of Spius Creek and tributaries and the upper reaches of the Coldwater River, where access to the spawning grounds requires passing through the lower sections before the stream temperatures create physiological thermal barriers. These returning adults pass through the lower reaches in May and June as the freshet starts to abate, then hold in deeper pools for two months until they spawn in mid-to-late August (R. Bailey, Nooaitch Band, pers. comm.).\nLocalized thermal disconnectivity in the lateral dimension occurs when rearing and out-migrating juveniles are unable to access side-channel and off-channel thermal refugia and holding pools due to changing channel processes exacerbated by upland management and the development of linear infrastructure including dykes, roads, railways, and trails. These groundwater-serviced reaches located in side channels or off-channel habitats provide thermal refuge for juvenile fish in the watershed, and can also provide critical refuge for returning spawners. When these lateral refugia become disconnected from mainstem channels, lethal stream temperatures can cause juvenile die-offs. Activities that restore and protect connectivity to these lateral refugia, particularly those cooled by groundwater sources, can help mitigate thermal disconnectivity in the watershed.\nMitigation of the landscape-scale drivers of changes to the thermal regimes are outside of the scope of this plan. While vital for the long-term resilience of the watershed, the broad land-use patterns, over-subscription of water withdrawals, and climate change that are causing chronic thermal issues in the watershed require more complex, coordinated, and resource-intensive solutions than this planning process can provide. This plan is intended to focus on the direct remediation and prevention of localized, physical barriers to lateral thermal refugia and longitudinal connectivity to maintain fish passage to spawning, rearing, and refuge habitat. Lateral, and associated thermal, connectivity was identified by the planning team as the primary connectivity concern in the watershed within the defined scope of this plan."

    "section": "Target species",
    "text": "Target species\nTarget species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved and/or restored in the watershed. In the Lower Nicola River watershed, the planning team selected Anadromous Salmonids as the target species group, which comprises Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, and Steelhead. The selection of these target species was driven primarily by the target species of the primary funds supporting this planning work. The planning team also identified other culturally and ecologically important species within the watershed to consider for inclusion in future iterations of the WCRP, including Kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka), Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), resident Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), Burbot (Lota lota), and Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha).\n\nAnadromous Salmonids\nAnadromous salmonids are cultural and ecological keystone species that contribute to productive ecosystems by contributing marine-derived nutrients to the watershed and forming an important food source for bears and other species (Schindler and Quay. (2003)). Salmon and Steelhead have enduring food, social, and ceremonial value for First Nations in Lower Nicola watershed – having sustained life, trading economies, and culture for the Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx and Syilx peoples since time immemorial (L. N. I. Band (2015), E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019), C. Band (2021)). The harvest and processing of these species have helped pass knowledge and ceremony to future generations (Council (n.d.), L. N. I. Band (2015)).\nAnadromous salmonid populations in the Lower Nicola River watershed have declined significantly since the mid-1980s, leading First Nations communities to voluntarily reduce their harvest (E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019)). The Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx and Syilx peoples have always been stewards of the lands, resources, and fisheries in their traditional territories through an interconnected relationship based on respect and reverence, captured by the Syilx concept of Tmixw – the people only take the salmon that is needed (L. N. I. Band (2015), E. T. Ltd. and Council (2019), U. N. Band (2021)). The stewardship of their waters continues through the work of the Scw’exmx Tribal Council, the four member communities, the Lower Nicola Indian Band, and initiatives like the Nicola Watershed Governance Project. The Chinook Salmon (Endangered), Coho Salmon (Threatened), and Steelhead (Endangered) populations have all been assessed and proposed for Species at Risk Act (SARA) listing by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). The development and implementation of this WCRP aims to support and supplement on-going work by the Nlaka’pamux/Scw’exmx, Syilx, and other local groups by providing an action plan to address the specific, tractable conservation threat posed by fragmentation through the restoration and preservation of habitat connectivity for these important species. See data methods for maps of modelled anadromous salmonid spawning and rearing habitat in the Lower Nicola River watershed.\n\n\nChinook Salmon | k’ʷy’íʔe/pəqéłus | Oncorhynchus tshawytscha\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Chinook Salmon Designated Unit assessment in the Lower Nicola River\nwatershed.

Ltd. (2007), E. Ltd. (2017)). Known and historic spawning locations include the mainstem Nicola River (mostly between the Coldwater River and Spius Creek confluences), Coldwater River, Spius Creek, lower portions of Clapperton Creek, and upstream of Nicola Lake in Moore Creek and the Upper Nicola River (L. Ltd. (2007), E. Ltd. (2017)). In addition to these spawning systems, important juvenile rearing areas have been observed in Juliet Creek and Voght Creek (L. Ltd. (2007)). Chinook Salmon stocks have been supplemented by the Spius Creek hatchery since the 1980s. Fry and smolt releases have occurred and the Nicola stock is current enhanced by ~200,000 coded-wire tagged yearling smolts annually as a component of the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) indicator stock study program (R. Bailey, pers. comm.).\n\n\nCoho Salmon | sx̣a̓yqs | Oncorhynchus kisutch\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Coho Salmon Designated Unit assessment in the Lower Nicola River\nwatershed.

(2017)). The majority of Coho Salmon spawning and rearing occurs in the Coldwater River, Spius Creek, and Maka Creek, but has also been observed in Clapperton Creek, Prospect Creek, and the Upper Nicola River and Moore Creek (L.

Steelhead spawning and rearing is known to occur in the lower portion of the mainstem Nicola River, Skuhun Creek, Shakan Creek, Nuaitch Creek, Maka Creek, the Coldwater River, Juliet Creek, Voght Creek, Prospect Creek, and Clapperton Creek (L. Ltd. (2007)). Historically, almost all third-order and greater streams would have supported Steelhead, and groundwater-fed thermal refugia continue to provide important rearing and holding habitats (E. Ltd.

    "section": "Barrier Types",
    "text": "Barrier Types\nThe following table highlights barrier types threatening anadromous salmonids in the watershed. The results of this assessment were used to inform the subsequent planning steps, as well as to identify knowledge gaps where there are limited spatial data to inform the assessment for a specific barrier type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Barrier types in the Lower Nicola River watershed and barrier rating assessment results. For each barrier type listed, ‘Extent’ refers to the proportion of anadromous salmonid habitat that is being blocked by that barrier type, ‘Severity’ is the proportion of structures for each barrier type that are known to block passage for target species based on field assessments, and ‘Irreversibility’ is the degree to which the effects of a barrier type can be reversed and connectivity restored. The amount of habitat blocked used in this exercise is a representation of total amount of combined thermal refuge, spawning, and rearing habitat.\n\n\nBarrier Types\nExtent\nSeverity\nIrreversibility\nOverall Threat Rating:\n\n\n\n\nLateral Barriers (including to thermal connectivity)\nHigh\nVery High\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\nNatural Barriers\nHigh\nVery High\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\nRoad-Stream Crossings\nVery High\nVery High\nLow\nMedium\n\n\nSmall Dams(&lt;5m height)\nMedium\nVery High\nMedium\nLow\n\n\nAbandoned Rail-stream Crossings (longitudinal)\nLow\nLow\nMedium\nLow\n\n\nTrail-stream Crossings\nLow\nLow\nLow\nLow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall Dams (&lt;3 m height)\nThere are 35 mapped small dams on “potentially accessible” stream segments in the watershed, blocking a total of 357.4 km (~67.24% of the total habitat) of modelled spawning and rearing habitat for anadromous salmon, resulting in a medium extent. The extent rating of these structures was confirmed by the planning team. There are two known fish-passage structures in the watershed, including on the dam at the outlet of McKinley Lake. The remaining dams likely block passage for anadromous salmon and would require significant resources to remediate. However, due to the limited extent of dams in the watershed, a final pressure rating of Medium was assigned. Four small dams were identified on the priority barrier list. Three of the dams require further assessment and confirmation of upstream habitat quality, and the dam observed at the outlet of Kwun Lake does not exist.\n\n\nRoad-stream Crossings\nRoad-stream crossings are an abundant barrier type in the watershed, with 80assessed and modelled crossings located on modelled Anadromous Salmonid habitat. Demographic road crossings (highways, municipal, and paved roads) block 55.39 km of habitat (57.4%), with 88% of assessed crossings having been identified as barriers to fish passage. Resource roads block 34.04 km of habitat (35.3%), with 73% of assessed crossings identified as barriers. Significant land use and linear development throughout the valley bottom has disconnected the Nicola River from important habitat in some tributaries, including Highway 5 and Highway 8 see Barrier Prioritization. The collective experience and input from the planning team resulted in a Low irreversibility rating due to the existing body of knowledge and resources to support the remediation of road-stream crossings, though it was noted that there is significant variability between resource roads and highway crossings.\n\n\nTrail-stream crossings\nThere is very little spatial data available on trail-stream crossings in the watershed, so the planning team was unable to quantify the true Extent and Severity of this barrier type. However, the planning team felt that trail-stream crossings are not prevalent within the watershed and that, where they do exist, they do not significantly impact passage for anadromous salmon. As most crossings will be fords or similar structures, remediation may not be required, or remediation costs associated with these barriers would be quite low. Overall, the planning team felt that the pressure rating for trail-stream crossings was likely Low; however, the lack of ground-truthed evidence to support this rating was identified as a knowledge gap within this plan.\n\n\nLateral Barriers (Including to thermal connectivity)\nThere are numerous types of lateral barriers that potentially occur in the watershed, including dykes, berms, and linear development (i.e., road and abandoned rail lines), all of which can restrict the ability of anadromous salmonids to move into floodplains, riparian wetlands, offchannel habitats, and other groundwater-fed thermal refugia. No comprehensive lateral barrier dataset exists within the watershed, so pressure ratings were based on qualitative local knowledge. Lateral barriers were identified as the primary connectivity concern in the watershed due to a High extent for all target species’ habitats and a Very high severity of barriers (i.e., almost all structures are blocking the movement of fish). Highway 5, Highway 8, and the two abandoned rail lines run along significant stretches of the Coldwater River and mainstem Nicola River and likely disconnect these mainstems from segments of their historic floodplains, off-channel habitats, and thermal refugia in certain locations. Other lateral barriers include irrigation infrastructure that occurs in the valley bottom on agricultural land. Overall, the planning team decided that a High pressure rating captured the effect that lateral barriers are likely having on connectivity in the watershed, particularly thermal connectivity, while recognizing that the lack of data on lateral barriers in the watershed is an important knowledge gap to fill.\n\n\nNatural Barriers\nNatural barriers to fish passage can include debris flows, log jams, sediment deposits, etc., but natural features that have always restricted fish passage (e.g., waterfalls) are not considered under this barrier type. Natural barriers are difficult to include in a spatial prioritization framework due to their transient nature. The planning team felt that the major drivers of natural barriers were massive sediment aggradation that has occurred in the watershed in recent years and changes in the natural flow regime of the watershed. The associated channel destabilization creates impassable stream segments due to a lack of flow and increased lateral migration of streams. The extent, severity, and passability of these obstacles will vary over time depending on the season and year; however, current and historic land-use practices, including forest harvesting, agriculture, and water withdrawals have exacerbated the effect of natural barriers in the watershed. Due to the nature of these land-use practices, the severity of natural barriers was rated as Very high and the irreversibility as Medium, the latter due to the effort required to rectify poor land-use practices at a watershed scale. Overall, the planning team felt that a pressure rating of ‘High’ adequately captured the effects of natural barriers.\n\n\nSmall Dams (&lt;5m height)\nThere are five mapped dams on modelled anadromous salmonid habitat in the watershed, blocking a combined 5.08 km (5.3%) of spawning and rearing habitat, resulting in a Low extent see barrier prioritization for dams included in the intermediate barrier list. The extent rating of these structures was confirmed by the planning team. There are three known fish passage structures in the watershed, including on Nicola Lake Dam, and the remaining dams likely block passage for anadromous salmonids. Many dams in the watershed are irrigation impoundments that are of little consequence to target species. Remediating dams requires significant resources; however, due to the minimal extent of dams in the watershed, a final pressure rating of Low was assigned to this barrier type\n\n\nAbandoned Rail-Stream Crossings (Logitudinal)\nThere are no active rail lines in the Lower Nicola watershed; however, infrastructure remains in place from the historic Nicola Valley Railway and the Kettle Valley Railway in the form of abandoned railbeds and associated stream crossings. There are 4 modelled abandoned railstream crossings located on modelled anadromous salmonid habitat, blocking a combined 1.94 km of habitat (2.01% of the total habitat blocked; see barrier-prioritization for abandoned rail-stream crossings included in the intermediate barrier list). There are no data to support the assessment of the severity of these crossings, but the collective knowledge of the planning team resulted in a Low severity rating because most are believed to be serviced by bridges or open-bottom structures. Despite the moderate technical knowledge and resources required to remediate these barriers, the low extent and low severity resulted in the overall pressure rating of Low. The abandoned rail lines, however, were identified by the planning team as a contributor to lateral and thermal disconnectivity in the watershed (see Lateral Barriers to Thermal Connectivity).\n\n\nTrail-stream Crossings\nThere are very little spatial data available on trail-stream crossings in the watershed, so the planning team was unable to quantify the true Extent and Severity of this barrier type. However, the planning team felt that trail-stream crossings are not prevalent within the watershed and that where they do exist, they do not significantly restrict passage for anadromous salmonids. Because most crossings will likely be fords or similar structures, the remediation costs associated with these barriers would be quite low. Overall, the planning team felt that the pressure rating for trail-stream crossings was likely Low\n\n\n\n\nBand, Coldwater. 2021. “Our Nlaka’pamux History.” Coldwater Band.\n\n\nBand, Lower Nicola Indian. 2015. “Community Profile.” Lower Nicola Indian Band.\n\n\nBand, Upper Nicola. 2021. “About Upper Nicola Band.” Upper Nicola Band.\n\n\nCouncil, Fraser Basin. n.d.

    "text": "Lower Nicola Watershed Barrier Prioritization Summary\nOne conservation outcome of the WCRP is the remediation of barriers to connectivity in the Lower Nicola River watershed, including lateral barriers to thermal refugia and longitudinal barriers. As a step toward the selection of projects for implementation to improve connectivity in the watershed, candidate barriers were prioritized to guide field verification of the sites through barrier assessments and habitat confirmations. The barrier prioritization results represent the best available knowledge at the time of publishing and the barrier lists will be iteratively updated over time.\n\nLateral Barriers (Including to thermal refugia)\nThere is a lack of comprehensive data and mapping of lateral barriers and potential thermal refugia in the watershed to support a strategic prioritization currently (see Action 1.3). However, local knowledge was used to compile a list of candidate sites for field verification as a starting point to improve lateral and thermal connectivity.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Identified priority lateral barrier remediation sites for field\nassessment in the Lower Nicola River watershed. UTM northing and\neastings refer to Zone 10.

The measures of currently accessible and total habitat values are derived from the intrinsic potential habitat model described in connectivity status.\n\n\nHabitat Type\nCurrently accessible (km)\nTotal\nCurrent Connectivity Status\nGoal\nGain required (km)\n\n\n\n\nRearing\n394.47\n531.51\n81%\n96%\n115.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe barrier prioritization process comprises three stages:\nStage 1: preliminary barrier list\nStage 2: intermediate barrier list\nStage 3: priority barrier list\nInitially, the barrier prioritization analysis ranked all barriers in the watershed by the amount of habitat blocked to produce a “preliminary barrier list”, which also accounted for assessing “sets” of barriers for which remediation could be coordinated to maximize connectivity gains. From this list, the top-ranking subset of barriers - comprising more barriers than are needed to achieve the goals - is selected to produce an “intermediate barrier list”. Barriers that did not rank highly in the model results, but were identified as priority barriers by the local partners were also added to the intermediate barrier list. A longer list of barriers is needed due to the inherent assumptions and uncertainty in the connectivity and habitat models and gaps in available data. Barriers that have been modelled (i.e., points where streams and road/rail networks intersect) are assumed to be barriers until field verification is undertaken and structures that have been assessed as “potential” barriers (e.g., may be passable at certain flow levels or for certain life history stages) require further investigation before a definitive remediation decision is made. Additionally, the habitat model identifies stream segments that have the potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for target species but does not attempt to quantify habitat quality or suitability, which will require additional field verification once barrier assessments have completed. As such, the intermediate barrier list below (Table 4) should be considered as a starting point in the prioritization process and represents structures that are a priority to evaluate further through barrier assessment and habitat confirmations because some structures will likely be passable, others will not be associated with usable habitat, and others may not be feasible to remediate because of logistic considerations.\nThe intermediate barrier list was updated following the barrier assessments and habitat confirmations that were undertaken during the 2021 field season - some barriers were moved forward to the “priority barrier list” (Table 5) and others were eliminated from consideration due to one or more of the considerations discussed in Table 3. The priority barrier list represents structures that were confirmed to be partial or full barriers to fish passage and that block access to confirmed habitat. Barriers on the priority list were reviewed by planning team members and selected for inclusion for proactive pursual of remediation. For more details on the barrier prioritization model, please see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Crossings removed from the intermediate barriers list following field\ninvestigations.

    "text": "Strategies & Actions\nIn 2021, the Lower Nicola River watershed and many other parts of BC experienced devastating forest fires and floods. Prior to this, CWF worked with the Scw’exmx Tribal Council to assess priority barriers that were identified through longitudinal models and undertake preliminary assessments of local priorities for potential lateral connectivity remediation. Recognizing that there may be other urgent restoration priorities in the watershed, the Planning Team decided that the current areas of focus will be on reviewing LiDAR, aerial imagery, and field assessments to determine immediate lateral connectivity needs (see Action 1.5 below), responding to new barriers that may have developed in the watershed, and addressing other emerging needs in the watershed. The Planning Team will focus on the remaining strategies and actions in the table below in future years.\nEffectiveness evaluation of identified conservation strategies and associated actions to improve connectivity for target species in the Lower Nicola River watershed. The planning team identified five broad strategies to implement through this WCRP, (1) lateral barrier remediation (priority on reconnecting thermal refugia), (2) stream crossing remediation, (3) dam remediation, (4) barrier prevention, and (5) progress tracking plan. Individual actions were qualitatively evaluated based on the anticipated effect each action will have on realizing on-the-ground gains in connectivity. Effectiveness ratings are based on a combination of “Feasibility” and “Impact”. Feasibility is defined as the degree to which the project team can implement the action within realistic constraints (financial, time, ethical, etc.) and Impact is the degree to which the action is likely to contribute to achieving one or more of the goals established in this plan."

    "section": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods",
    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods\nThe connectivity status assessment for anadromous salmonids in the Lower Nicola River watershed builds on existing connectivity modelling work undertaken by the BC Fish Passage Technical Working Group, resulting in a flexible, customizable open-source spatial model called “bcfishpass”. The model spatially locates known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identifies potential spawning and rearing habitat for target species, and estimates the amount of habitat that is currently accessible to target species. The model uses an adapted version of the intrinsic potential (IP) fish habitat modelling framework (see Sheer et al. (2009) for an overview of the IP framework). The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each target species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021). The variables and thresholds used to model potential spawning and rearing habitat for each target species are summarized in Table 1. The quantity of modelled habitat for each species was aggregated for each habitat type to inform two of the KEAs — Accessible Spawning Habitat and Accessible Rearing Habitat — and represents a linear measure of potential habitat. To recognize the rearing value provided by features represented by polygons for certain species (e.g., wetlands for Coho Salmon) a multiplier of 1.5x the length of the stream segments flowing through the polygons was applied.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Parameters and thresholds used to inform the intrinsic potential\nhabitat model for spawning and rearing habitat for each target species\nin the Lower Nicola River watershed.
